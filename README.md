# tweets-export

## About
This contains the last good backup of my (@ultimape's) twitter in as raw as a format as possible.

 This should contain all my tweets up to 2023-08-19 (August 19th, 2023).

This is intended to seed tooling and other resources for analysis and easier managment outside of the twitter ecosystem.
The final export contained 112.1K posts and 10180 images and took up an entire 1.9GB zip file.

If you're here because I am leaving Twitter/X, please know I will be keeping my [website's colophon](https://scat.wovensoup.com/colophon) up-to-date with where you can best find me elsewhere.

## A Note on Compressed Files

Some of the files are individually archived in a compressed zip format.
Any good decompression tool should work to extract them. I tend to use [7-Zip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Zip)

The tweets.js files were too big to upload into github directly (they were just over the 100MB limit, so it is [compressed in a .zip file](https://github.com/ultimape/tweets-export/raw/main/accounts/16288000/data/tweets.zip)

Likewise, due to the sheer volume of images over the years, you will also have [to decompress the multi-part (001-174) tweet-media.zip file](https://github.com/ultimape/tweets-export/tree/main/accounts/16288000/data/tweets_media) as well as other zip files if you want to view the other images.

## How to Download
